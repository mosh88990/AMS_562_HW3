This repository contains classes for Point, Line, Rectangle, and Square objects. The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of object-oriented-programming by implementing a set of shapes as classes. The include folder includes header files for each class that is implemented. The src folder includes the cpp files for each class that is implemented. The tests folder includes the test cpp file. There is a testfile to test the functions used in these classes, in order to run it use the 'make' command and then run the executable file. The functions for the Point object are distanceFromOrigin, distanceTo, and toString. The functions for the Line object are length, slope, and yInt. The functions for the Rectangle object are area, perimeter, and liesInside. The Square object has an area function.
